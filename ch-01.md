# An Example Section

This is section is dedicated to displaying different Markdown capabilities. For starters, note that the header of this section is clearly a header. Create these by typing a pound sign (#), a space right after, and then the name of your header. A different number of pound signs denotes a different "level". See how the following section has a smaller header. The next section utilizes two pound signs instead of just one.

## Text Formatting

You can also do some formatting for regular text. You might _italicize_ some words, **bold** others, or even attach a [link](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/your-first-book.html) to others. If your class necessitates it, you may also write complex math expressions (eg. $E=mc^2$) or code (eg. `print("hello")`). You might also choose to write these in their own separate lines:

$$E=mc^2$$

```{code-cell}
print("hello")
```

Note that this line of code also displayed the output. While this may be helpful for small examples of code, more complex code might require a Jupyter Notebook.
